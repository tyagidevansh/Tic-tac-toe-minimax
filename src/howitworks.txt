1. Title gets put on screen
2. Status is displayed
3. Status is a variable which first checks if there is a winner
    (does not call a function, just checks if another variable winner === null)
4. 3 divs get created, each div has a row of 3 buttons
5. Each button (custom react component square) is assigned a value from an array called squares. The 
    button then calls a function onSquareClick and and that in turn calls a function handleClick.
6. This means that by default, the button displays the value which is in the array at the specified
    idex. When the user clicks the button onSquareClick is called and handleClick is called.
7. HanddleClick takes a parameter i (index of the buttton in the array). first it checks if there is a 
    value at squares[i]. Then it calls calculateWinner on the squares array. If there is an element at 
    squares[i] or there is a winner, the function returns.
8. Otherwise, it creates a new array called nextSquares and copies the squares array into it using the 
    slice() function. The line "nextSquares[i] = isXnext ? 'X' : 'O';" checks if X is the next value or not.
    isXnext is a state which gets its intial value randomly from Math. 
9.Handleclick sets the state if square to nextsquares and flips the value of isXnext.
10.It sets the state of winner (if winner exists) and sets showPopup to true.
11. If winner exists, Popup gets called from a seperate file. Popup takes three props: the value of the winner,
    onClose (calls the handlePopupClose function) and onPlayAgain (calls the onPlayAgain function).
12. handlePopupClose is called when user clicks the close button on the modal and simply sets showPopup to false.
13. handlePlayAgain is called when user clicks play again and it sets all the elements of the squares array to null.
    It also setisXnext to true (idk why really, should prob remove it), sets Winner to null and sets showPopup to false.
Now to handle the Ai moves,
